<br>
I am in eid holiday as I am in an arabic coundry - the UAE
<br> 
but that means more holidays for me!!
<br> 
I dont mind that at all!!!
<br>
I just started html coding
<br>
Its hard
<br>
but I did this ENTIRE thing by myself!
<br>
Thats cool
<br>
This is my homework
<br>
I am doing it now so I dont forget about it!
<br>
I think this is supposed to be about my school
<br>
I just finished my exams
<br>
I got a really good mark, full marks in math!
<br>
Probably becuase my moms a math teacher
<br>
But I got the best grades in my class!!!
<br>
I am happy with my grades
<br>
I have had holidays on Monday, Tuesday, Wednsday, Thursday and today is Friday.
<br>
I didnt go to school on tuesday because I had to go to my new school for a transition!
<br> 
it was really fun
<br>
I had ice cream there
<br>
On monday I left early, and on Wednsday I didnt feel like going
<br>
Well thats my school life I guess.
<br>

<br>
Thats all my school life, I finished everything, the entire primary school!
