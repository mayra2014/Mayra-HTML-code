What is HTML?
</H3>
<h4>
    <p>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content 
on the web. It uses tags—like h1 for headings, p for paragraphs, and a for links—to organize
and display information in a browser. HTML forms the basic building blocks of any website,
giving structure to text, images, videos, and other elements. While it doesn’t handle styling or interactivity on its own,
 it works closely with CSS for design and JavaScript for dynamic features. Every webpage you see online starts with HTML.

    Why is HTML important?
</h3>
<p>
<h4>
HTML is important because it’s the foundation of every website.
 It gives structure to content—like headings, paragraphs, images, and links—so 
 that web browsers know how to display them. Without HTML, websites
 would just be plain text with no layout, organization, or interactivity.
  It’s the first step in building anything on the web!
